Yoinks bandcamp songs for free lul

Bandcamp Yoinker abuses a how bandcamp streams their songs to download songs from artists for free.
The quality wont be the best, but it is downloadable. 
There are a few ways to use this, the Javascript and the Java.

## How to Use - Java
* To use Bandcamp Yoinker, you have to take the code and put it into your choice of IDE, I use intellij.
* Then all you have to do is run it and type in the link of the ALBUM you want to download from bandcamp. For now singles arent working right.
* From there it will automatically fetch all songs from the album and download them with the correct names to the specified path at the top.
* This will only work for artists that have their songs set to be able to stream.

## How To Use - Javascript
* To use Bandcamp Yoinker, you have to take the code(bookmarklet) and copy it into a bookmark.
* Press (Ctrl+D), press more and then paste the code(bookmarklet) into url.

* To use the actual code, you will have to open the console and paste it (ctrl+shift+i)

* After that, you can go to an artists album or song of your choice and just click the bookmark. Then you want to open the console (ctrl+shift+i) and it will show you the links and names of all the songs in the album.
